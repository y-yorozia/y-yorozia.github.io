* My story
** A humble beginning
My name is Youssef, or Joseph in English. I am 26 years old and live in Morocco. I am currently looking for a mentor. 

My story began with me being a gifted child, or so I was told. 
I was getting good grades simply by attending classes without doing any extra work at home, and it was from there that my addiction to games and interest in education began.

At the age of 15, I met my first girlfriend in a game called Dofus, but our relationship remained online until the age of 18. 

I started university at the age of 18 and planned to major in chemistry.
I encountered a few minor issues.
The first issue was a change in language; we had previously studied in Arabic, and it was changed to French.
The second issue was that the classes were extremely long for what I was used to.
The third issue was that my online girlfriend, with whom I had spent three years, was six years older than me and had recently gotten engaged. And I only found out because her friend told me, since she felt sorry for me.

I felt betrayed because I had worked on construction sites since I was 16 to earn enough money to stay online with her all year, as well as spend money in game to progress together.
I failed four years in a row due to depression, anxiety, and changes in the university education system.
I didn't tell anyone, I didn't ask for help; I was simply done.
** A new goal
One day, I saw a video on YouTube one day that changed my career goals.
When I was despaired to feed on videos so that I can sleep without thinking of my life...
A video from TED Talks by Hans Rosling, recorded in February 2006 in Monterey, CA, published on YouTube on January 16, 2007. the video name is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w][The best stats you've ever seen | Hans Rosling]].
Seeing how data can be used to change your world view made me excited to work in this field.
After some research, I discovered that the field's name is data analysis, and that I could find and pirate courses for it, so I chose data science courses, specifically [[https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/][Udemy - Data Science from Jose Portilla]] and [[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp][Udemy - Data Science from 365 Careers]].

** Work-related desperation
*** The jack of all traits
In late 2019, my friend and I decided to try a drop-shipping business, and we endeed up purchased a service called Launchese that assists with getting accepted in payment gateways.
Long story short, we were lacking in terms of funding and I ended up working in a company called AOP+ that is also owned by the CEO of Launchese.
Despite the fact that my role was in customer service, I decided to assist the company in any way I could.

I assisted the product manager by creating detailed reports for each product, which required me to expand the app's collected data by splitting the SKU variable into multiple variables to create a detailed report.
And to reduce the number of refunds/reorders, I assisted the shipping department by gathering data from the Shipstation app, manipulating it, and reporting back orders with missing phone and home/apparent numbers.
I was a Jack of all trades and a master of none, but I was only getting paid $10 a day. I ended up quitting. and back to square one.

And then, when I thought things cannot get any worse, Covid happened.
*** The hidden data scientist
Fast-forward, A friend who work as a freelancer offer me a job.
He was working with an influencer marketing agency, and he asked me to do some manual tasks.
- The task was done in steps:
  - Accessing Noxinfluencer and applying country and subscriber count filters.
  - Access to each channel's page and manually check for some conditions that were as followed:
    - Number of videos in the channel is bigger than 15
    - Copy the channel's email if found in description of about page.
    - Average video length is three minutes or more
    - Average video views is 10k or more
    - No content for kids
    - Content have narration.
    - maximum subscriber count for our task was 100k
The situation was, I work to find the channels, and he does a quick review and report them to the employer.
The payment was as followed, $10 for each 30 channels found with a monthly upper limit of $300, plus you get 5% for each sponsorship deal, for life.
Each month I find 900 channels, he does a quick review and report them back to the employer, we get $300 and split it in half.
Of Course, I wasn't in the slack group, so I had no idea which one accept a sponsor deal or not to know how much we gain in total.
I was getting paid $10 per 30 channels found, with a limit of $300 per month, or at least that what I was told, and we were splitting it in half.
Doing the task manually, we were finding, on average, five channels per hour. I wrote a programming script that helped us find, on average, 30 channels per hour. Details are in here.
Here is the script [[file:20230308T205456--scraping-from-noxinfluencer-and-adding-additional-filters__script.html][Link]], and here is the final result [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AOB_LgcKwXpTA5IqGIzYd0XxYlmlYIe?usp=share_link][Link]].
But there was still that limit of $300 per month that limit us from taking advantege of this data that I gather.
So I make him two proposals: the first is to ask them to raise the limit, and the second is to introduce me to them as a data scientist, in the hopes that I will gain recognition and begin freelancing.
He didn't like both, He start diminishing the value of my work and joking about how I spend my first cash pay, which was only $90, on buying a weight gainer we because I was so underweight.
He wanted me to be under his control, just producing him easy money and not helping me as he claimed. He was basically a tyrant.
He got the data, [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AOB_LgcKwXpTA5IqGIzYd0XxYlmlYIe?usp=share_link][Link]], to help him in his task.
He ignored me after this, he still holds my money and still generates money from my work.
And I thought that I would never be betrayed.

There I was, at the age of 26, unemployed, uncertified, fed up with life. I still can't put my hand on what went wrong.
** A new view
Until again, on YouTube, I saw another video that changes my views on, not on the world, but on my self.
Nobody, especially parents, consider teaching how to study, how to manage time, how to plan and avoid risk, to a gifted child.
Because, well, you demonstrated your intelligence when you were given children's study material, let's just leave you alone.
Now I'm not going to point fingers, but that's my parent mistakes, however I am willing to fix it alone as always.
I learned from that video that I have ADHD. Which is strange because I was always a calm kid, but the symptoms are there.

I'm currently studying ADHD materials, primarily those two materials [[https://www.healthygamer.gg/about/guide][Dr. Kâ€™s Guide to Mental Health]] and [[https://www.amazon.com/ADHD-2-0-Essential-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0399178732][ADHD 2.0]], because I can't afford to see a psychiatrist.
I am so used to learning a skill when I need it that I even studied how to make a story from this course to write this story. Of course, this isn't the best story, but I can't blame myself for my limited vocabulary.

At the end, I want to finish with two things.

I am willing to work for free in order to gain experience. The thing is, I live in a Third World country, so even if I am paid half of what a data scientist is paid, I will be fine. I would prefer more, but I will be fine.

Since I write my story for you, whether you will be my future employer or colleague, I would like to show you a poem that resonate with me.
The poem is named The Greatest Adventure, it is a song written by Maury Laws (music) and Jules Bass (lyric) and performed by Glenn Yarbrough.

The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.
Today and tomorrow are yet to be said.
The chances, the changes are all yours to make.
The mold of your life is in your hands to break.

The greatest adventure is there if you're bold.
Let go of the moment that life makes you hold.
To measure the meaning can make you delay;
It's time you stop thinkin' and wasting the day.

The man who's a dreamer and never takes leave
Who thinks of a world that is just make-believe
Will never know passion, will never know pain.
Who sits by the window will one day see rain.

The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.
Today and tomorrow are yet to be said.
The chances, the changes are all yours to make.
The mold of your life is in your hands to break.

The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.

* Programing langauges
- Languages
  - Python
    Only what is needed for data science, I don't use functions often nor did I ever use classes. You can check my python scripts below.
  - SQL
    Never performs a query, I don't event know what setup is needed, all I know is the syntax. Check my Google data analytics notes.
  - R
    I only used R for statistical computation from the course data analysis with R, It is sad to say this but, I don't event know how to manipulate data frames in R.
* Tools I work
- Tools I work with
  - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Gnu Emacs]] just a *normal* text editor.
  - [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] just a *normal* text format, with an Excel like functionality, the ability to run codes within the note... All the notes that I wrote, especially the notes of statistics with R of which I am very proud of, are writing in org mode format.
    Here is an example [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/y-yorozia/y-yorozia.github.io/main/20221031T171547--data-analysis-with-r-specialization__dataanalysis_math_note_summary.org][a note in org mode]]
