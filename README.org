* About me
Hello My name is Joseph, I am 26 years old, and I live in Morocco.

I am a self-taught data analyst/scientist who developed an interest in data from watching a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w][Ted Talk by Hans Rosling]].
I studied most of the concepts from YouTube, and now I studied on Coursera using auditing.

Currently, I am seeking work with a team, either as a freelancer or an intern.
My last projects involve scraping and developing a metric to ease decision-making.
* Project
- A script I made recently for an influencer marketing agency that put additional variables in a channels' database from NoxInfluencer.
  Those variables are served as a filter, instead of visiting a channel and judging if it is a good fit, you just apply a couple of filters.
  This database helped them find potential channels for sponsorship deals five time faster. [[file:20230308T205456--scraping-from-noxinfluencer-and-adding-additional-filters__script.html][Project link]]
- A little script that scrapes recipes database, plus images uploaded by users.
  All recipes were collected and assigned a score base on rating, when it was published and amount of engagement...
  Images were assessed as well with BRISQUE algorithm that returns a score base on image sharpness. [[file:20230316T175650--scraping-recipes-from-allrecipes-com__script.html][Project link]]
- A little script that I wrote to add additional filters to a rent website in my country.
  There is some basic filter in the search page, but each apartment page have additional information.
  - The script is simple:
    - Scrape and get all apartment links
    - Scrape and get all feature from each apartment
    - Decide which apparent I should rent base on low price and high number of features.

* Notes
I only audited courses on Coursera, All I have are notes to prove it.
- [[file:20220418T115131--excel-skills-for-business-specialization__note.html][Notes]] from the Coursera course [[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/excel][Excel Skills for Business Specialization]]
- [[file:20220715T073848--google-data-analytics__coursera_google_cnotes_datascience.org][Notes]] and a summary diagram from the Coursera course [[https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics][Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate]]
- [[file:20221031T171547--data-analysis-with-r-specialization__dataanalysis_math_note_summary.html][Notes]] from the Coursera course [[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics][Data Analysis with R Specialization (previously known as *Statistics* with R)]]
  This note has a lot of math formulas written in $LaTeX$, it may take a while to load.
* Tools I use
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Gnu Emacs]] just a *normal* text editor.
- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] just a *normal* text format, with an Excel like functionality, the ability to run codes within the note... All the notes that I wrote, especially the notes of statistics with R of which I am very proud of, are writing in org mode format.
  Here is an example [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/y-yorozia/y-yorozia.github.io/main/20221031T171547--data-analysis-with-r-specialization__dataanalysis_math_note_summary.org][a note in org mode]]
- Excel
- Jupyter notebbok
- Google colab
- Rstudio

* Programing langauges 
- Python
  Only what is needed for data science, I don't use functions often nor did I ever use classes. You can check my python scripts below.
- SQL
  Never performs a query, I don't event know what setup is needed, all I know is the syntax. Check my Google data analytics notes.
- R
  I only used R for statistical computation from the course data analysis with R, It is sad to say this but, I don't event know how to manipulate data frames in R.
* Library
- Pandas
- Numpy
- sklearn
- beautifulsoup
- selenuim
- [[https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/][Plotly express]]
- opencv2
- [[https://github.com/photosynthesis-team/piq][PIQ]] used in my latest project
