Presenting is like a journey for the audience.<br />
At the starting point of the journey, we want the audience to have an idea about the end goal, so they get a sense on how do we progress towards it.<br />
We can start with a <b>short story</b>, painting a picture of what would the world be like if the problem is fixed.<br />
<br />
Having passion towards your field and presenting with the spirit of giving will encourage the audience to listen.<br />
<br />
We should not start the presentation by presenting our credentials or qualification as for why the audience should listen to us.<br />
Also we should not start the presentation by laying out facts and arguments.<br />
People feel challenged, and they will start looking holes in your presentation instead of following your story.<br />

You cannot complete a jigsaw puzzle without the image in the front.<br /></li>
<li>Chose or comeup with a story<br /></li>
<li>Make an outline (deconstructing the story)<br />
We can keep asking "how", "why", "what" until we get to the causes or reasons (depending on the story).<br /></li>

<li>Talk slowly, even if you think you are too slow.<br /></li>
<li>Make eye contact, or stare just above the audience head, they won't know the difference, but they will feel connected.<br /></li>
<li>You don't have to know all the answers, don't try to fake it, or else very thing you said, even if it was true, will be doubted.<br /></li>

<li>The end<br />
How will restricting phone usage durring dinenr table improve humman connection.<br /></li>
<li>The story<br />
Recently I was out on a dinner with a friend that I haven't seen in a while, she went hiking a mountain in her vacation, I felt quite adventures just by listening.<br />
Then came my turn to tell what I did on my vacation, in the middle of me telling my story, her phone lit up, she grabbed her phone and she started half looking at me while scrolling with her finger.<br />
Here I am, trying to share what happened to me with a close friend, but what happened in her phone was more important.<br />
I felt neglected, but worse than that, I do this to my friends at the dinner table, and somehow I try to justify that what I am doing is necessary.<br /></li>
<li>Outlines<br />
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why do we tell our stories/events to our friends? Why do we have friends in the first place?<br />
Humans succeed in this earth by working together, it is rare for someone to succeed, completely, alone.<br /></li>
<li>Why as humans choose to work only with some people and not all people?<br />
Our human instinct doesn't let us work on important stuff with someone that we don't full trust. Because of this, trust cannot be built overnight, not bought.<br /></li>
<li>How do we hummans build trust?<br />
We build trust by connecting and talking with each other to know one person's struggles, point of views, feelings, plans, ethics&#x2026;<br /></li>
<li>How long is it to build trust through connection?<br />
It takes a long time, building trust is like an investment.<br /></li>
<li>What can interrupt building trust?<br />
Building trust interrupt by interrupting communication<br /></li>
<li>Why do we allow devices that interrupt communication in our lives?<br />
We are addicted, we are now so afraid of missing out on something that a notification take all our attention away from what in front of us.<br /></li>
<li>How can we stop being interrupted by notification?<br />
Blocking notification, turn off your phone completely, or if you are <b>bold</b>, leave your phone in your home when you are out.<br /></li>
