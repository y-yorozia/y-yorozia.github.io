<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
My name is Youssef, or Joseph in English. I am 26 years old and live in Morocco. I am currently looking for a mentor.<br />
</p>

<p>
My story began with me being a gifted child, or so I was told.<br />
I was getting good grades simply by attending classes without doing any extra work at home, and it was from there that my addiction to games and interest in education began.<br />
</p>

<p>
At the age of 15, I met my first girlfriend in a game called Dofus, but our relationship remained online until the age of 18.<br />
</p>

<p>
I started university at the age of 18 and planned to major in chemistry.<br />
I encountered a few minor issues.<br />
The first issue was a change in language; we had previously studied in Arabic, and it was changed to French.<br />
The second issue was that the classes were extremely long for what I was used to.<br />
The third issue was that my online girlfriend, with whom I had spent three years, was six years older than me and had recently gotten engaged. And I only found out because her friend told me, since she felt sorry for me.<br />
</p>

<p>
I felt betrayed because I had worked on construction sites since I was 16 to earn enough money to stay online with her all year, as well as spend money in game to progress together.<br />
I failed four years in a row due to depression, anxiety, and changes in the university education system.<br />
I didn't tell anyone, I didn't ask for help; I was simply done.<br />
</p>

<h3 id="org637dfc5"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> A new goal</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
One day, I saw a video on YouTube one day that changed my career goals.<br />
When I was despaired to feed on videos so that I can sleep without thinking of my life&#x2026;<br />
A video from TED Talks by Hans Rosling, recorded in February 2006 in Monterey, CA, published on YouTube on January 16, 2007. the video name is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w">The best stats you've ever seen | Hans Rosling</a>.<br />
Seeing how data can be used to change your world view made me excited to work in this field.<br />
After some research, I discovered that the field's name is data analysis, and that I could find and pirate courses for it, so I chose data science courses, specifically <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/">Udemy - Data Science from Jose Portilla</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp">Udemy - Data Science from 365 Careers</a>.<br />

<p>
In late 2019, my friend and I decided to try a drop-shipping business, and we endeed up purchased a service called Launchese that assists with getting accepted in payment gateways.<br />
Long story short, we were lacking in terms of funding and I ended up working in a company called AOP+ that is also owned by the CEO of Launchese.<br />
Despite the fact that my role was in customer service, I decided to assist the company in any way I could.<br />
</p>

<p>
I assisted the product manager by creating detailed reports for each product, which required me to expand the app's collected data by splitting the SKU variable into multiple variables to create a detailed report.<br />
And to reduce the number of refunds/reorders, I assisted the shipping department by gathering data from the Shipstation app, manipulating it, and reporting back orders with missing phone and home/apparent numbers.<br />
I was a Jack of all trades and a master of none, but I was only getting paid $10 a day. I ended up quitting. and back to square one.<br />
</p>

<p>
And then, when I thought things cannot get any worse, Covid happened.<br />

<p>
Fast-forward, A friend who work as a freelancer offer me a job.<br />
He was working with an influencer marketing agency, and he asked me to do some manual tasks.<br />
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The task was done in steps:<br />
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Accessing Noxinfluencer and applying country and subscriber count filters.<br /></li>
<li>Access to each channel's page and manually check for some conditions that were as followed:<br />
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Number of videos in the channel is bigger than 15<br /></li>
<li>Copy the channel's email if found in description of about page.<br /></li>
<li>Average video length is three minutes or more<br /></li>
<li>Average video views is 10k or more<br /></li>
<li>No content for kids<br /></li>
<li>Content have narration.<br /></li>
<li>maximum subscriber count for our task was 100k<br /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
The situation was, I work to find the channels, and he does a quick review and report them to the employer.<br />
The payment was as followed, $10 for each 30 channels found with a monthly upper limit of $300, plus you get 5% for each sponsorship deal, for life.<br />
Each month I find 900 channels, he does a quick review and report them back to the employer, we get $300 and split it in half.<br />
Of Course, I wasn't in the slack group, so I had no idea which one accept a sponsor deal or not to know how much we gain in total.<br />
I was getting paid $10 per 30 channels found, with a limit of $300 per month, or at least that what I was told, and we were splitting it in half.<br />
Doing the task manually, we were finding, on average, five channels per hour. I wrote a programming script that helped us find, on average, 30 channels per hour. Details are in here.<br />
Here is the script <a href="20230308T205456--scraping-from-noxinfluencer-and-adding-additional-filters__script.html">Link</a>, and here is the final result <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AOB_LgcKwXpTA5IqGIzYd0XxYlmlYIe?usp=share_link">Link</a>.<br />
But there was still that limit of $300 per month that limit us from taking advantege of this data that I gather.<br />
So I make him two proposals: the first is to ask them to raise the limit, and the second is to introduce me to them as a data scientist, in the hopes that I will gain recognition and begin freelancing.<br />
He didn't like both, He start diminishing the value of my work and joking about how I spend my first cash pay, which was only $90, on buying a weight gainer we because I was so underweight.<br />
He wanted me to be under his control, just producing him easy money and not helping me as he claimed. He was basically a tyrant.<br />
He got the data, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AOB_LgcKwXpTA5IqGIzYd0XxYlmlYIe?usp=share_link">Link</a>, to help him in his task.<br />
He ignored me after this, he still holds my money and still generates money from my work.<br />
And I thought that I would never be betrayed.<br />
</p>

<p>
There I was, at the age of 26, unemployed, uncertified, fed up with life. I still can't put my hand on what went wrong.<br />

<div id="outline-container-org0660663" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0660663"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> A new view</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Until again, on YouTube, I saw another video that changes my views on, not on the world, but on my self.<br />
Nobody, especially parents, consider teaching how to study, how to manage time, how to plan and avoid risk, to a gifted child.<br />
Because, well, you demonstrated your intelligence when you were given children's study material, let's just leave you alone.<br />
Now I'm not going to point fingers, but that's my parent mistakes, however I am willing to fix it alone as always.<br />
I learned from that video that I have ADHD. Which is strange because I was always a calm kid, but the symptoms are there.<br />
</p>

<p>
I'm currently studying ADHD materials, primarily those two materials <a href="https://www.healthygamer.gg/about/guide">Dr. K’s Guide to Mental Health</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ADHD-2-0-Essential-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0399178732">ADHD 2.0</a>, because I can't afford to see a psychiatrist.<br />
I am so used to learning a skill when I need it that I even studied how to make a story from this course to write this story. Of course, this isn't the best story, but I can't blame myself for my limited vocabulary.<br />
</p>

<p>
At the end, I want to finish with two things.<br />
</p>

<p>
I am willing to work for free in order to gain experience. The thing is, I live in a Third World country, so even if I am paid half of what a data scientist is paid, I will be fine. I would prefer more, but I will be fine.<br />
</p>

<p>
Since I write my story for you, whether you will be my future employer or colleague, I would like to show you a poem that resonate with me.<br />
The poem is named The Greatest Adventure, it is a song written by Maury Laws (music) and Jules Bass (lyric) and performed by Glenn Yarbrough.<br />

<p>
The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.<br />
Today and tomorrow are yet to be said.<br />
The chances, the changes are all yours to make.<br />
The mold of your life is in your hands to break.<br />
</p>

<p>
The greatest adventure is there if you're bold.<br />
Let go of the moment that life makes you hold.<br />
To measure the meaning can make you delay;<br />
It's time you stop thinkin' and wasting the day.<br />
</p>

<p>
The man who's a dreamer and never takes leave<br />
Who thinks of a world that is just make-believe<br />
Will never know passion, will never know pain.<br />
Who sits by the window will one day see rain.<br />
</p>

<p>
The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.<br />
Today and tomorrow are yet to be said.<br />

The mold of your life is in your hands to break.<br />
